# 485. Max Consecutive Ones

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

Pretty easy problem but fumbled a bit for not reading the description properly, initially made it for any number, after knowing just binary numbers will be there, i solved it easily.
